    <p id="history">
        The first restaurant was opened in Beverly Hills in 1985. After 
        the first restaurant opened, it quickly expanded to other parts of 
        the world. This includes over 30 states in the US and 11 countries. 
        Not only can you find California Pizza restaurants in many places, 
        but you can also find some of their famous pizzas at some grocery 
        stores in the frozen ailse. This way, you can eat their famous 
        pizzas while you are out and about, or in the comfort of your own 
        home!

    <p>
        Almost all their dishes are good, but there are two in 
        particular that are quite tasty.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Original BBQ Chicken Pizza
    </p>

    <p>
        This pizza is topped with BBQ sauce, smoked Gouda, red onions and fresh
        cilantro. You also have the option to top it with bacon and pineapple. 
        I highly suggest the pineapple. Once you are finished, for dessert, you 
        can have the Butter Cake, which goes very well with this pizza.
    </p>

    <p> 
        Garlic Cream Fettuccine
    </p>

    <p>
        If you are not completely crazy about the pizza, this is the perfect 
        dish for you. This dish is a pasta that has fresh Italian parsley, and 
        an option to top it with chicken and/or shrimp, and Sauteed Cremini 
        Mushrooms. This dish also goes very well with the Butter Cake.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you decide that the Butter Cake is not for you, I recommend 
        trying the Salted Caramel Pudding. This dessert is the perfect 
        mixture of sweet and salty, which is bound to make anyone smile!
