            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <p>Serves 2 people</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Chicken: I typically sauté diced boneless skinless chicken breasts for the enchilada filling. 
                    But feel free to use pre-cooked chicken (such as a shredded rotisserie or any leftover diced/shredded baked chicken) 
                    if you would like to save some prep time.</li>
                <li>Onion and diced green chiles: White, yellow or red onion will work for the enchilada filling sauté. 
                    Then I always like to add in a can of diced green chiles too for extra flavor.s</li>
                <li>Beans: I typically add a can of black beans or pinto beans to the filling for extra protein. 
                    But white beans, lentils or chickpeas would also work well here.</a></li>
                <li>Corn tortillas are traditionally used in Mexican-style enchiladas, but I typically use flour tortillas 
                    (which are more commonly used in Tex-Mex and American-style enchiladas) since they are much easier to roll. 
                    That said, just about any style of tortillas will work in this recipe.</li>
                <li> I most often use either Asadero, Pepper Jack, or a Mexican-blend of shredded cheese for these enchiladas. 
                    But feel free to use any type of shredded cheese that you love best.</li>
                <li>Toppings: When it comes to enchiladas, I vote the more toppings the merrier! 
                    Any combination of chopped fresh cilantro, sliced avocado, diced red onion (or quick pickled red onions), 
                    sliced radishes, fresh or pickled jalapeños, sour cream or Mexican crema, and/or extra cheese would be delicious!</li>
                <li>Enchilada sauce: Finally, you can use any type of enchilada sauce that you prefer for this recipe.</li>

            <h3>Preparation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Prep oven and enchilada sauce. Preheat oven to 350°F.  Prepare your enchilada sauce.</li>
                <li>Sauté the filling mixture. In large sauté pan, heat oil over medium-high heat. 
                    Add onion and sauté for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. 
                     Add diced chicken and green chiles, and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper.  
                     Sauté the mixture for 6-8 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until the chicken is cooked through.  
                     Add in the beans and stir until evenly combined.  
                    Remove pan from heat and set aside.</li>
                <li>Bake. Bake uncovered for 20 minutes, 
                    until the enchiladas are cooked through and the tortillas are slightly crispy on the outside.  
                    Transfer the baking dish to a wire baking rack.</li>
                <li>Adjust seasoning as needed.</li>
                <li>Serve. Serve the enchiladas immediately while they’re nice and hot and melty, 
                    garnished with lots of fresh toppings. Enjoy!</li>
